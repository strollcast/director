# Strollcast

**Listen to research papers while you stroll.**

Strollcast transforms dense academic papers into engaging audio podcasts that you can enjoy during walks, commutes, or any time you're on the move. Each episode features a conversational format with two hosts breaking down complex concepts into accessible explanations.

## How It Works

We take influential machine learning and systems papers and convert them into ~25-30 minute podcast episodes. Each episode covers:

- The core problem and motivation
- Key technical contributions
- Practical implications and real-world usage
- Comparisons with alternative approaches
- Best practices and recommendations

## Available Episodes

| Paper | Authors | Year | Duration |
|-------|---------|------|----------|
| [PyTorch FSDP: Experiences on Scaling Fully Sharded Data Parallel](zhao-2023-pytorch-fsdp/) | Zhao et al. | 2023 | 24 min |

## Format

Each paper folder contains:
- `script.md` - The full podcast transcript
- `podcast.m4a` - The audio file (iPhone/Android compatible)
- `generate.py` - The generation script used

## Usage

1. Browse the available episodes above
2. Download the `.m4a` file to your phone
3. Put on your headphones and go for a stroll
4. Learn about cutting-edge research while getting fresh air
